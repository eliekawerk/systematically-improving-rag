# The RAG Flywheel
## Data-Driven Product Development for AI Applications

_A systematic approach to building self-improving AI systems_

---

### Beyond Technical Implementation to Product Excellence

Most RAG tutorials teach you how to build a system. This course teaches you how to build a **product** that continuously improves and delivers increasing value over time.

### The Improvement Flywheel

At the core of this course is the RAG improvement flywheel - a continuous cycle that transforms user interactions into product enhancements:

```
Synthetic Data & Evaluation â†’ Learning from Evaluations â†’ UX Design & Feedback â†’ 
User Segmentation & Analysis â†’ Building Specialized Capabilities â†’ Unified Architecture â†’ 
(cycle repeats)
```

## Course Structure

### **Introduction: Beyond Implementation to Improvement**
Understand why systematic improvement matters and how to approach RAG as a product rather than just a technical implementation.

### **Chapter 1: Starting the Flywheel**
Learn how to overcome the cold-start problem, establish meaningful metrics, and create a data foundation that drives product decisions.

### **Chapter 2: From Evaluation to Enhancement**
Transform evaluation insights into concrete product improvements through fine-tuning, re-ranking, and targeted enhancements.

### **Chapter 3: The User Experience of AI**
- **Design Principles**: Create interfaces that delight users
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather valuable user insights
- **Iterative Improvement**: Build virtuous cycles of enhancement

### **Chapter 4: Understanding Your Users**
- **Topic Modeling & Analysis**: Discover user query patterns
- **Prioritization**: Identify high-value improvement opportunities

### **Chapter 5: Building Specialized Capabilities**
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Handle documents, images, tables
- **Implementation**: Build purpose-built solutions for different needs

### **Chapter 6: Unified Product Architecture**
- **Routing**: Intelligent query routing
- **Tools**: Building specialized tools
- **Improvement**: Continuous architecture enhancement
