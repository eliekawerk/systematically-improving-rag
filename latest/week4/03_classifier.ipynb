    "# Week 4 - Systematically Improving Your Rag Application\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Please make sure that you've completed the notebooks - [1. Generate Dataset](1.%20Generate%20Dataset.ipynb) and [2. Topic Modelling](2.%20Topic%20Modelling.ipynb) before proceeding so that you understand the dataset, topics we're working with and why we're doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a classifier that takes the topics that we've identified in the previous notebook and use it to classify new queries into the topics that we've identified. This helps us track performance over time and alert us when specific query types need attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "By having a system that can automatically classify new queries as they come in, we can monitor the distribution of queries over time and determine if a topic is relevant to our overall RAG application. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on coding, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define Query Categories\n",
    "- Convert topic insights into clear categories\n",
    "- Structure classifications in YAML format\n",
    "- Make categories easy for teams to update\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build a Classifier\n",
    "- Use LLMs for accurate query classification\n",
    "- Validate results against defined categories\n",
    "- Handle edge cases and ambiguous queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Monitor Performance\n",
    "- Track classification accuracy over time\n",
    "- Identify problematic query types\n",
    "- Use metrics to guide improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a working classifier that can automatically tag incoming queries. This builds on our topic modeling work while preparing us for more advanced query handling in Week 5."

    "## Defining Query Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we used topic modelling to generate topics from our dataset. Through that we realised that there were a significant number of queries related to refunds that we were performing poorly on. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also learnt that we could break down user intent into these 3 distinct categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Payment Method Changes: Users frequently need to switch payment methods after making a purchase. This highlights a need for clearer instructions on how to update payment information before due dates, as many express confusion about locating this option in the app.\n",
    "2. Early Payoff Requests: Many users want to pay their balance in full rather than continuing with installments. This reflects a desire for flexibility in payment schedules and suggests that the option to pay early may not be prominently displayed or intuitive to find.\n",
    "3. Payment Due Date Concerns: Several queries express anxiety about upcoming payment deadlines and potential consequences. This indicates an opportunity to improve notification systems and provide clearer information about payment timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to take these insights and build out a classifier that can assign these four types of queries to new queries so that we can monitor and improve our performance on them over time. We can do so using a simple `.yaml` file that contains the categories we've identified over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've defined a few categories in our `categories.yml` file that we'll use to classify our queries. This makes it easy to add new categories in the future and allow other members of the team to add new categories as they see fit."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 4, we built a complete workflow for understanding and improving how we handle user queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We created diverse synthetic queries by varying personas, intents, and question types\n",
    "2. We used topic modeling to discover that refund-related queries were a major pain point\n",
    "3. We built a classifier that can automatically tag incoming queries based on these insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic approach allows us to spot new query patterns as they emerge, track satisfaction scores and volume for each query type, and make sure that we're improving our system over time. This sets us up well for week 5 where we'll add structured metadata to our documents. For example, when we see lots of queries around payment methods, we might add specific methods for people to make that change automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight from Week 4 is that we can't improve what we don't measure. By building systems to track and categorize queries, we create a data-driven foundation for systematically improving our RAG application over time."
