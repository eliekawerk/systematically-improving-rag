    "# Week 6 - Systematically Improving Your Rag Application\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Make sure that you've completed the previous notebooks `1. Evaluate Tools` and `2. Generate Dataset` before continuing with this notebook. We'll be using the results from the previous notebook to evaluate the effectiveness of our new techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to improve our model's ability to select the right tools using system prompts and few-shot examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying RAG systems that coordinate multiple tools, getting tool selection wrong wastes resources and degrades user experience. Simple techniques like system prompts and few-shot examples can significantly boost tool selection accuracy without complex infrastructure changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as Week 1 showed how synthetic data could improve retrieval, and Week 4 demonstrated how topic modeling helps understand query patterns, strategic prompting can help models better understand when and how to use different tools. By systematically testing these improvements against our evaluation framework, we can quantify exactly how much each change helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on experimentation with a personal assistant chatbot, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leverage System Prompts\n",
    "- Write effective prompts that explain tool usage patterns\n",
    "- Help models understand user workflows and preferences\n",
    "- Validate prompt improvements with metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Design Few-Shot Examples \n",
    "- Create examples that demonstrate correct tool combinations\n",
    "- Target specific failure modes identified in testing\n",
    "- Balance example diversity and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measure Improvements\n",
    "- Compare performance before and after changes\n",
    "- Track precision and recall across different approaches\n",
    "- Make data-driven decisions about prompting strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to systematically improve tool selection accuracy through better prompting, and how to measure the impact of these changes using objective metrics."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've shown how simple techniques like few-shot prompting and system prompts can significantly boost model performance in tool selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Baseline | System Prompt | System Prompt + Few Shot |\n",
    "|--------|----------|---------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Precision | 0.45 | 0.64 (+42%) | 0.79 (+76%) |\n",
    "| Recall | 0.40 | 0.54 (+35%) | 0.84 (+110%) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These gains came from two key insights : clear system prompts help models understand tool usage patterns (like using Teams for work vs Discord for gaming), while targeted examples prevent common mistakes like forgetting to find a chat before sending a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the systematic pattern we've followed throughout the course. Each week started by defining clear metrics to optimize - whether that was MRR and recall for retrieval (Week 1), recall and MRR for metadata filtering in Week 5, or precision metrics for tool selection here in Week 6. With these metrics in place, we could use synthetic data to rapidly test improvements and validate the improvements that our changes have on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we deploy these systems to production, this data-driven approach becomes even more crucial. By collecting real user feedback through UI elements like thumbs up/down ratings and establishing clear evaluation metrics early, teams can quantify the impact of each change they make. This systematic strategy - defining metrics, using synthetic data for rapid testing, then validating with real user feedback - provides a reliable framework for improving RAG systems even as they grow more complex with multiple data sources, tools and retrieval methods."
