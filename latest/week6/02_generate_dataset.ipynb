    "# Week 6 - Systematically Improving Your Rag Application\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Make sure that you've ran the previous notebook `1. Evaluate Tools.ipynb` before continuing. A lot of the code in this notebook will be based off the evaluation methods that we cover in that notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll create a synthetic dataset of user queries to evaluate our model's ability to select the right tools. By generating realistic test cases, we can identify common failure modes and measure how well different approaches handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying RAG systems with multiple tools, we need confidence that our models will select the right tools for each user request. Manual testing misses edge cases and can't scale. By generating synthetic test queries that deliberately target potential failure modes - like selecting between similar tools or coordinating multiple steps - we can systematically identify and fix weaknesses in our tool selection logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on testing with a Raycast-inspired tool selection system, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify Key Failure Modes\n",
    "- Understand common tool selection mistakes\n",
    "- Map out similar tools that cause confusion\n",
    "- Spot missing dependencies between tools\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate Strategic Test Data\n",
    "- Create queries that target specific weaknesses\n",
    "- Test tool combinations systematically\n",
    "- Validate query realism and diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Benchmark Performance\n",
    "- Measure precision and recall on synthetic data\n",
    "- Track improvements across different approaches\n",
    "- Identify which tools need more attention\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a set of test queries that can be used to systematically evaluate and improve your tool selection logic."

    "## Our Initial Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We've downloaded a list of commands ahead of time in a `raw_commands.json` file. These consist of a set of commands that we've downloaded from the `raycast` application ahead of time as well as some additional commands that we've added to the application.\n",

    "- `extension` : This is the name of the extension that the command belongs to\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to ensure we have a unique command for each extension, we'll concatenate the `extension` and `command_name` fields together to form a unique key. This will help avoid a situation whereby we have multiple commands with the same name in different extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg. If our Obsidian and Apple Notes extensions both use the same `search` command, we'll have two commands with the same name. This would be very confusing and hard to test. So we would get our unique key here as `obsidian.search` and `apple-notes.search` which helps solve this issue.\n"

Feature Release ) and a page when we'd like to keep it around for a longer period (Eg. Onboarding Document, Team Handbook, Incident Reports that we want to refer to down the line). Use filters for common queries/views that I need to refer to \n",
    "- Notion is used for planning trips, tracking expenses and other forms of long term planning. \n",
    "- Apple notes are used for quick notes that are more one-off. Examples of these notes includes recipes, shopping lists, notes about a movie we want to watch, things to note down etc, todo lists, reminders etc\n",

    "- Google Search is used for searching the web for information\n",
    "- iMessage is used for sending messages to friends and family. These messages are short informal and mostly about the weather, plans for the weekend, coordinating certain events, looking up appointments etc\n",
    "- Discord is used for gaming - so we'll use it for sending messages that are related to gaming and coordinating these gaming sessions with friends\n",
    "- Teams is used for sending messages for work stuff - we might use it to send messages to a channel or to a specific person in response to certain work related projects, requests, developments etc\n",

    "- Github is used for tracking pull requests, collaborating with other developers, running tests and deploying code (Eg. What's the update on the CI, is there a new release of the app, what's the status of the new feature branch, any new security vulnerabilities that we flagged, any new PRs to review etc)\n",

We started with a yaml taxonomy that's easy for team members to modify, then used it to generate synthetic queries that test specific failure modes like missing dependencies, wrong tool choices, and over-reliance on general commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "We applied the same precision and recall metrics from Week 1's retrieval evaluation to measure tool selection accuracy. Our synthetic dataset revealed key weaknesses: models skip required setup steps (like `findChat` before `sendMessage`), pick wrong tools (using GitHub instead of Confluence for docs), and default to general commands instead of specialized ones. Finding these patterns lets us target improvements effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final notebook, we'll improve our model's performance by adding system prompts that explain user workflows and few-shot examples showing correct tool combinations. With our test set and metrics in place, we can measure exactly how much these changes help. This matches our core goal throughout the course - making systematic, measurable improvements backed by data."
