# Week 5: Structured Data and Metadata Enhancement

## Overview

This week addresses a fundamental limitation of pure semantic search: the inability to handle queries with specific constraints or requirements. While semantic search excels at finding conceptually similar content, it struggles with queries like "red sneakers under $100" or "invoices from Q3 2023." By incorporating structured metadata and database integration, you can build RAG systems that handle these complex, real-world queries effectively.

The approach combines the strengths of multiple retrieval methods: vector search for semantic understanding, metadata filtering for specific constraints, SQL queries for database information, and structured extraction from documents. This multi-modal retrieval strategy enables your RAG system to answer questions that would be impossible with semantic search alone, dramatically expanding its practical utility.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:

- Extract structured metadata from unstructured content using multimodal LLMs
- Implement hybrid retrieval combining vector search with metadata filtering
- Safely integrate SQL generation for database queries in RAG systems
- Parse PDF documents while maintaining citation capabilities
- Build query understanding systems that route to appropriate retrieval methods
- Validate extracted data against predefined schemas
- Measure performance improvements from structured data integration

## Datasets

- **ClothingControlV2**: Product images from Hugging Face for metadata extraction exercises
- **Product Database**: Synthetic inventory with stock levels, pricing, and user order history
- **Invoice Samples**: PDF documents demonstrating structured extraction challenges

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this week's materials, you'll have:

1. A multimodal metadata extraction pipeline for product data
2. Hybrid retrieval system outperforming pure semantic search by 20-40% on constraint queries
3. Safe Text-2-SQL integration for database queries
4. PDF parsing system with precise citation capabilities
5. Understanding of when to apply each retrieval method

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Metadata extraction producing inconsistent results

**Solution**: Refine your taxonomy to be more specific and add validation rules. Use few-shot examples in your extraction prompts.

### Issue 2: SQL injection concerns with Text-2-SQL

**Solution**: Always use read-only database connections and validate generated SQL against a whitelist of allowed operations.

### Issue 3: PDF parsing missing content or layout

**Solution**: Ensure Poppler is properly installed. For complex PDFs, consider using different extraction modes in docling.

## Next Steps

- Complete notebooks in order as concepts build progressively
- Experiment with different metadata schemas for your use case
- Review Week 6 to see how tool selection extends these concepts
- Consider implementing hybrid retrieval in your production systems

**Note**: The techniques in this week are essential for production RAG systems. Real-world queries often contain specific constraints that pure semantic search cannot handle, making structured data integration a critical capability.
